 Multi-Class Image Classification Project (PyTorch)

This project implements a full pipeline for real-world image classification using PyTorch. The model is trained on labeled image data stored with filename references in a CSV file. The system is designed to handle multiple classes (0â€“9 or more) using an architecture inspired by real-world inference pipelines.
